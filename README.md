# dial-up-simulator
a c# form program in windows 95 style that simulates a dial up connection.

To use this program download the "installation files" folder and run the .exe file. \n
If you wanna run the program at the computer startup create a link in the "shell:startup" folder. \n
IMPORTANT: the .exe file and the .wav file MUST be in the same path, else you got to edit the project by changing the audio file path. \n
